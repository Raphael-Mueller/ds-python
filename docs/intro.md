# Welcome

Welcome to our course Applied Statistics!

 In this course you will learn state-of-the art statistical methods, which refers to a set of tools for making sense of complex datasets. statistical learning has become a critical toolkit for anyone who wishes to understand data — and as more and more of today’s jobs involve data, this means that statistical learning is fast becoming a critical toolkit for everyone.

Learn how to explore, visualize, and analyze data to understand natural phenomena, investigate patterns, model outcomes, and make predictions, and do so in a reproducible and shareable manner. Gain experience in data collection, wrangling, and visualization, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and effective communication of results while working on problems and case studies inspired by and based on real-world questions. The course will focus on the R statistical computing language. No statistical or computing background is necessary.
