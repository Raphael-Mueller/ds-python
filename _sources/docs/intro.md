# Welcome

The goal of this book is to give you a first impression of some important tools and concepts in Python when doing data science projects.   

A typical data science project looks something like this {cite:p}`Wickham2016`: 

```{image} ../_static/img/process.png
:alt: datascience
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:width: 600px
:align: center
```

Surrounding all the steps covered above is programming. You donâ€™t need to be an expert programmer to be a data scientist, but learning more about programming pays off because becoming a better programmer allows you to automate common tasks, and solve new problems with greater ease.
